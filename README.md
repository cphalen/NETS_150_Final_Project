# NETS_150_Final_Project
Final project for NETS 150 Spring 2020

This project was created by Annie Wang, Ben Demers, and Campbell Phalen. Below are brief
instructions for installation and running.

  1) Download the repository
  2) Download the Twitter data from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C_Rsp8QghbqK-61vN-Tn5YYIJIovOG8-/view?usp=sharing
  3) Place the data.csv file in the root directory
  4) Download twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar and add this to your Java build path
  
Now you are good to go. If you run into any issues, let us know. If the access token are
deprecated, that is because I got anxious that people would find them and post
embarassing things on my Twitter wall. You can simply insert your own (find them
on Twitter) into the twitter4j.properties file for consumer key and consumer secret.
